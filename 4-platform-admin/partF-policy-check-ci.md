## Part F - Add Policy Checks to CI/CD

Policy Controller provides a powerful, flexible way to automatically check incoming resources against org policies. But Policy Controller's setup - as a Kubernetes admission controller, at the gate of the API - means that it can only "catch" (and block) out-of-policy resources on the fly, as they are trying to be deployed through `kubectl`, CI/CD, or some other means. 

For app developers or operators who need to create or edit application YAML files - including those in the cymbalbank-app-config repo, outside of the policy repo - this setup isn't ideal. Because it means that they only know their resources are out of policy at the very moment they get deployed. For policies that only apply to production, they may not know their resources are out of policy until they go through all the effort to write and test code, get PR reviews, run unit tests, etc., only to have to double back and create another PR or roll back the commit. 

So as a platform admin, I want to empower all the developers in my org to know if and when their resources are non-compliant, and have a chance to make changes. And ideally I want multiple layers of enforcement against the same set of policies. Lucky for us, there's a way to integrate Policy Controller into our existing CI, on top of the "at deploy time" enforcement Policy Controller already does. Let's see how.

**1. Clone the `cymbalbank-app-config` repo in this directory.** 

```
git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_USERNAME/cymbalbank-app-config
```

**2. View the `cloudbuild-ci-pr-policy.yaml` file in the `app-ci` directory.** 

```
cat/app-ci/cloudbuild-ci-pr-policy.yaml
```

Expected output: 

```
# Source: github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/anthos-config-management-samples/tree/main/ci-app/app-repo/cloudbuild.yaml
steps:
- id: 'Render prod manifests'
  name: 'gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk'
  entrypoint: '/bin/sh'
  args: ['-c', 'mkdir hydrated-manifests && kubectl kustomize overlays/prod > hydrated-manifests/prod.yaml']
- id: 'Clone cymbalbank-policy repo'
  name: 'gcr.io/kpt-dev/kpt'
  entrypoint: '/bin/sh'
  args: ['-c', 'kpt pkg get https://github.com/$$GITHUB_USERNAME/cymbalbank-policy.git@main constraints
                  && kpt fn source constraints/ hydrated-manifests/ > hydrated-manifests/kpt-manifests.yaml']
  secretEnv: ['GITHUB_USERNAME']
- id: 'Validate prod manifests against policies'
  name: 'gcr.io/config-management-release/policy-controller-validate'
  args: ['--input', 'hydrated-manifests/kpt-manifests.yaml']
availableSecrets:
  secretManager:
  - versionName: projects/${PROJECT_ID}/secrets/github-username/versions/1 
    env: 'GITHUB_USERNAME'
timeout: '1200s' #timeout - 20 minutes
```

This pipeline has three steps: 
1. **Render prod manifests** - Remember that the cymbalbank-app-config repo has a `base/` directory and two overlays, `dev/` and `prod/`. We'll generate
2. **Clone the cymbalbank-policy repo** - Also remember that this build is running in the cymbalbank-app-config repo, so in order to check those manifests against our policies, we have to clone them in from the policy repo. Also notice that there is a `kpt fn source` command. [**kpt**](https://googlecontainertools.github.io/kpt/) is a KRM package management tool that's still in early development at the time of writing this demo, so we aren't covering it much. All you need to know for the purpose of this build, is that `kpt fn source` means, "run a function called `[source](https://googlecontainertools.github.io/kpt/guides/consumer/function/catalog/sources/)`" to write the compiled policies in `cymbalbank-policy` to the `hydrated-manifests/` directory. 
3. **Validate prod manifests against policies** - Up to now, we've seen Policy Controller work at the admission control level of our GKE clusters. Here, the Policy Controller logic is actually running in a container called `policy-controller-validate`. It can do the same thing that the Admission Controller does - take some incoming KRM (in this case, the contents of the cymbalbank-app-config pull request) and check them against the Constraints in our polciy repo. 

**3. Copy the Cloud Build pipeline into the `cymbalbank-app-config` root and push to the `main branch`.** 

```
cp app-ci/cloudbuild-ci-pr-policy.yaml cymbalbank-app-config/
cd cymbalbank-app-config
git add . 
git commit -m "Add CI for pull requests - policy check"
git push origin main
```

**4. Create a new Cloud Build trigger corresponding to this new policy check pipeline, by navigating to the Console > Cloud Build > Triggers > Create.**

We want to run this pipeline anytime someone puts out a pull request with updated application YAML. 

- **Name**: `continuous-integration-app-policy`
- **Event**: Pull Request
- **Source**: `cymbalbank-app-config`
- **Base Branch**: `^main$`
- **Configuration**: `Cloud Build configuration file` 
- **Cloud Build configuration file location**: `cloudbuild-ci-pr-policy.yaml`

Click **Create**. 

**5. Return to the terminal, and still in the `cymbalbank-app-config` root dir, check out a new branch, `nginx`.**

```
git checkout -b nginx
```

**6. Copy the `test-workload.yaml` Service we used earlier in this demo into the `cymbalbank-app-config` repo, under the `base/` manifests.**

Given that we committed a policy to `cymbalbank-policy` stating that only up to 2 containers are allowed per Pod, we expect the pipeline to fail, with the same Policy Controller error we saw when trying to `kubectl apply -f` this same Deployment. Also update the base `kustomization.yaml` to bring the nginx Deployment into the baseline manifests it knows about. 

```
cp ../constraint-limit-containers/test-workload.yaml ./base/
echo "\n- test-workload.yaml" >> ./base/kustomization.yaml
```

**7. Commit the file to the `nginx` branch.**

```
git add .
git commit -m "Add nginx Deployment"
git push origin nginx
```

**8. In a browser, navigate to `github.com/your-github-username/cymbalbank-app-config`.**

Put out a new Pull Request for the `nginx` branch, into the `main` branch. 

**9.  Navigate back to Cloud Build > History, and watch the build run.** 

You should see an error in the third step, matching the Policy Controller error you saw when trying to `kubectl apply -f` the nginx resource earlier. 

```
Status: Downloaded newer image for gcr.io/config-management-release/policy-controller-validate:latest
gcr.io/config-management-release/policy-controller-validate:latest
Error: Found 1 violations:

[1] Number of containers in template (4) exceeds the allowed limit (3)
```

**TODO** - how to make the policy controller validate image know about constraint template `K8sNoExternalServices` ? 

**ðŸŽŠ Nice work!** You just added a second layer of policy checks to your Kubernetes platform, helping app developers understand if their resources are in compliance, even before their PRs are reviewed.
