# 2 - Setup 

This directory contains Terraform and Cloud Build resources to set up a basic GKE cluster with the CymbalBank app's KRM resources deployed to it. 

Note: This setup process will also create a Github repository in your account, and you will push the CymbalBank manifests to that repo.

## Prerequisites 

1. A Google Cloud project 
2. A Github account (you will be creating 3 new repositories overall). 
3. The following tools installed in your local environment: 
- git
- [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- [kubectl](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/components/install) - you can install this via gcloud: `gcloud components install kubectl`
- [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx#installation)
- [terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) 

4. A Github Personal Access token that Terraform can use to create a Github repo on your behalf. See instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). 

## Steps 

1. **Create a Google Cloud project** or get the ID of an existing project.

2. **Clone this repo.**

```
git clone https://github.com/askmeegs/intro-to-krm
cd intro-to-krm/2-setup/ 
```

3. **Set environment variables.**

```
export PROJECT_ID="<your-project-id>" 
export GITHUB_USERNAME="<your-github-username>" 
```

4. **Enable Google Cloud APIs.**  

```
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com sqladmin.googleapis.com

```

5. **Replace the values in `terraform.tfvars`** with the values corresponding to your project. You can pick any GCP region / zone. 

```

```

**Note**: if you choose a different zone from `us-central1-b`, you have to change the cluster zone in `cloudbuild.yaml`. 

6. **Set up application default credentials** for your project - this allows Terraform to create GCP resources on your behalf. 

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

7. **Run `terraform init`.** This downloads the providers (Github, Google Cloud) needed for setup. On success, you should see: 

```
Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

8. **Run `terraform plan`.** This looks at the `.tf` files in the directory and tells you what it will deploy to your Google Cloud project. 

```
Plan: 7 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  + kubernetes_cluster_host = (known after apply)
  + kubernetes_cluster_name = "cymbal-test-1"
  + project_id              = "krm-awareness"
  + region                  = "us-central1"
```

9. **Run `terraform apply`.** It will take a few minutes for Terraform to set up the cluster and the Cloud Build pipeline. When the command completes, you should see something similar to this: 

```
Apply complete! Resources: 7 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

kubernetes_cluster_host = "<IP>"
kubernetes_cluster_name = "cymbal-test-1"
project_id = "your-project-id"
region = "us-central1"
```


10. **Connect to your new GKE cluster.**

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials cymbal-test-1 --zone us-central1-b --project ${PROJECT_ID}
```

11. **Authenticate Cloud Build to your Github account.** Navigate to the Cloud Build console and click "Connect Repository" in the top menubar. Follow the steps to allow Cloud Build to authenticate - select the `cymbalbank-app-config` repo. Skip the `Create Trigger` step; this was already completed by Terraform.

12. **Clone your new CymbalBank app config repo**, copy the manifests and push to the `main` branch. This will trigger the Cloud Build pipeline created by Terraform in the previous step. 

```
git clone "https://github.com/${GITHUB_USERNAME}/cymbalbank-app-config"
cd cymbalbank-app-config; mkdir manifests/; 
cp -r ../app-manifests/ manifests/ 
cp ../cloudbuild.yaml .
git add .; git commit -m "Initialize repo"; git push origin main;   
```

13. **Navigate to Cloud Build** in the Google Cloud Console to view the build status. You should see a success message once Cloud Build deploys your repo's app manifests.

14. **Verify that the CymbalBank app has been deployed** to your cluster. 

```
$ kubectl get pods 

NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

userservice-7c9bc855f5-p898j          1/1     Running   0          2m28s
```

You can visit the CymbalBank frontend by getting the frontend Service's load balancer IP, and navigating to that IP in a web browser. 

```
$ kubectl get svc frontend

NAME       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
frontend   LoadBalancer   10.155.254.143   <YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP>     80:31521/TCP   93s
```

ðŸŽŠ **Congrats**! You just deployed KRM to a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster via CI/CD.
