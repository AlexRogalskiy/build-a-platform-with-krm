# 3 - App Development with KRM   

This demo shows how an app developer can develop features in a Kubernetes environment using GKE, Cloud Code, skaffold, and kustomize, without having to create or edit any KRM (YAML). This demo also shows a CI/CD pipeline, using Cloud Build, that shows how features get from development to production in a Kubernetes environment.


## What you'll learn  
- How to set up IDE-to-Kubernetes deployment using VSCode, Google Cloud Code
- How skaffold works with container builders like Docker and Jib to auto-build source code
- How to set up a multi-step CI/CD pipeline for Github pull requests using skaffold 
- How to test and stage source code in GKE environments that mimic production
